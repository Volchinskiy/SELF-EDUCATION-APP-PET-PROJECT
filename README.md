I study programming every day and some information is not remembered as well as I would like it to be. Therefore, I decided to create an application that will improve this process. later I will form the first concept of all this and add instructions for use.

I think I will first write this application using React, TypeScript on the client side and Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB on server side.

later I want to implement the same frontend design but on other popular libraries and the server on Python. because i'm ***interested***
